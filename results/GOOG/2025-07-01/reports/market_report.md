GOOG's July 1, 2025 stock analysis reveals conflicting signals. While the 50-day SMA shows a medium-term uptrend, the 200-day SMA indicates a long-term bearish bias. Critically, GOOG's current price ($177.39) is well above both, suggesting a strong bullish impulse and potential trend reversal. However, short-term momentum is weakening: MACD shows a recent bearish crossover, and RSI is declining (though still neutral). Volatility (ATR) has slightly increased. The rising VWMA and price above it confirm recent gains are volume-backed. Traders should be cautious; a near-term pullback is possible despite recent strength. Monitoring MACD/RSI for future direction is advised.
